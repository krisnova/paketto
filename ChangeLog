CVS	3/17/2003
	Jason added mingw32 support on mingw/linux and mingw/win32.

1.10  12/24/2002
      OpenBSD support thanks to Matt Watchinski; Solaris support with
      the help of Jason Spence.  New "Distco" mode actively discovers
      distance to remote hosts via analyzing the TTL in returned
      TCP RSTs. (Filipe Almeida pointed out that RSTs dont get their
      TTLs reset, so RST TTL = distance there and back.  Nice!)
      Cleanups to fix endianness issues.  Libnet was patched to
      pack its variables, which is needed if you want to
      overlay libnet structures directly onto libpcap frames.
      Traceroute hopcount determination returned
      to analyzing returned source ports instead of returned IP ID
      values, temporarily fixing Solaris fixed IP ID bug on
      L3 Raw Sockets.  Proper documentation remains to be written,
      but some useful material has been provided.  Finally...
      Happy Holidays!

1.00  First public release not from a Singaporean cyber cafe :-)

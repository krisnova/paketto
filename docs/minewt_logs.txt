You must specify an internal IP(-i) to accept packets for translation.
You must specify an external IP(-I) to send translated packets from.
You must specify the gateway IP(-r) or MAC[-R] to send translated packets to.

  minewt 1.0:   Userspace NAT/MAT Gateway
Component of:   Paketto Keiretsu 1.0;    Dan Kaminsky  (dan@doxpara.com)

  Min. Usage:   minewt -i internal_ip -I external_ip -r gateway_ip
     Options:   -d/-D [device]: Internal/External Device
                -m/-M [MAC]   : Internal/External MAC Address
                -a/-A [MAC]   : Internal/External MAC Address (ARP Packets Only)
                -i/-I [IP]    : Internal/External IP Address
                -r/-R [IP/MAC]: Upstream Router's IP / MAC Address
                -t   [timeout]: Maximum silence before connection state dropped
                -v            : Increase Verbosity
                -l            : Forward incoming connections to this IP
                -g/-G         : Disable Internal/External Gratuitous ARP
  Experiments:  -s/-S         : Embed state in IP Timestamps(Mode 3/Mode 4)
                -F            : Set split-on-fragment for IP Timestamps
                [MAC] = R     : Set MAC to Random    (00:??:??:??:??:??)
                [MAC] = B     : Set MAC to Broadcast (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)
                [MAC] = M     : Set MAC to Multicast (01:00:5E:11:22:33)
                [MAC] = MR    : Set Random Multicast (01:00:5E:??:??:??)
        Notes:   nCast MACs attached to External and/or External ARP using
                 -MMR/-AMR/-MB *may* spawn basic Guerilla Multicast traffic.
                 Simply ARPing with an otherwise silent MAC address may
                 also work.
